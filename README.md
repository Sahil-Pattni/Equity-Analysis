<!-- Description -->
This is a simple equity analysis tool that gives you an overview of any publicly traded company. It uses the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) to get the data and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to display it. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more features as I go along.

Currently, looking up a ticker (e.g.) will give you the following information:
- Company Name
- Company Description
- Basic Financials (Pirce, Market Cap, P/E Ratio, Dividend Yield)
- An interactive candlestick chart of the last 100 days of trading
- Quarterly Income Statements
- Quarterly Balance Sheets
